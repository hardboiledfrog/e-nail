# e-nail
This sketch file is a closed loop temperature controller with PID for my e-nail rig using an arduino mega2650 and an inexpensive popular Chinese ZVS induction heating module.

I use an A123 4S1P LiFePo battery pack (about 13v) for power and portability but it should work with any good power supply capable of supplying 12v at 10A-15A. 

It uses a rotary encoder and an OLED display for parameter selections and start / stop control. The temperature can be adjusted in +/- 10 degree increments during a session.

It is necessary to add a 0.1uf ceramic capacitor from each thermocouple wire to ground on the thermocouple breakout board to filter the high frequency noise generated by the ZVS heater module. I added chip caps right on the board but you can also just use caps with wire leads with one end inserted into the terminal block with each wire and the other end connected to the ground wire.

I will be posting a wiring diagram when I get it finished or you can easily figure out the connections from the sketch.
If you have soldering skills I recommend mounting the components on the Proto-Shield, otherwise you can just use the jumper wires listed below to connect the parts directly to the mega2650 without the shield board.
